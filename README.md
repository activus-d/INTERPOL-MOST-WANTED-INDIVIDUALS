## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript Vannilla
- Media Queries


### What I learned
I was able practice better with web responsivness. I learned also to make a submission button look pressed with CSS. I learned ho to clear multiple data from dom to enable the input of frsh data without havig to reload the webpage.

```
-proud of this css styling
```CSS
button:active {
    cursor: pointer;
    transform: translateY(0.5rem);
    background: rgb(64, 135, 64);
    color: white;
    box-shadow: 0.2rem 0.2rem 0.2rem 0.2rem rgb(6, 102, 27);
}
```

### Continued development
I need to lean transition so as bring more life into the styling of subsequent webpages
